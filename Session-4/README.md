# ðŸ§’ JavaScript for Kids - Session 4: Functions

Welcome to **Session 4** of our JavaScript journey! ðŸŽ‰  
In our last session, you learned how to use **if statements** and **conditions** to make your code smart and responsive.

Now it's time to learn one of the most powerful tools in programming: **functions**.

## ðŸ§  What is a Function?

A **function** is like a **machine** or **recipe** in your code.

You:

1. Give it a **name**
2. Write **instructions** inside it
3. Call (use) the function when you need it

ðŸ”§ Think of it like a blender:  
Put in ingredients (input), press a button (call the function), and get a smoothie (output)!

## ðŸ§¾ Why Use Functions?

Functions help you:

- Avoid repeating the same code
- Organize your program into sections
- Reuse code many times with different values
- Make your code clean and easier to understand

## ðŸ§± Function Syntax

Hereâ€™s how to create and use a function in JavaScript:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello there!");
  console.log("Welcome to my program.");
}

greet(); // Call the function
```
