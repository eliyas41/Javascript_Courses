# ðŸ§’ JavaScript for Kids - Session 7: Objects

Welcome to **Session 7**! ðŸŽ‰  
Last time, you learned how to work with **arrays** â€” lists of items like scores, favorite foods, and more.

Today, weâ€™ll take things further by learning about a special data type called **objects**.

Objects are perfect for organizing information in a real-world way â€” like storing everything about a person, book, game, or car.

## ðŸ§  What is an Object?

An **object** is a group of related data stored in **key-value pairs**.

ðŸ“¦ Imagine an object as a **box** with labels:

- The labels are the **keys** (name, age, etc.)
- The contents are the **values** ("Sara", 13, etc.)

## ðŸ§¾ Object Syntax

```js
let student = {
  name: "Sara",
  age: 13,
  grade: "7th",
  isPresent: true,
};
```
