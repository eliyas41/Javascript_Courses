# 🧒 JavaScript for Kids - Session 5: Loops

Welcome to **Session 5** of your JavaScript learning adventure! 🌀  
In the last session, you learned about **functions** — how to create blocks of reusable code.

Now it's time to level up and learn how to **repeat** actions using **loops**.

## 🔁 What Is a Loop?

A **loop** is a tool that helps you run the same code **again and again**, automatically.

👀 Imagine telling a robot:

> “Say hello 10 times.”

Without a loop, you'd have to write this:

```js
console.log("Hello");
console.log("Hello");
console.log("Hello");
// …again and again…
```
