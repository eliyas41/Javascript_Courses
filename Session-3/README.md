# ðŸ§’ JavaScript for Kids - Session 3: Operators and Conditions

Welcome to **Session 3**! ðŸŽ‰  
In the last session, we learned about:

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types: string, number, boolean
- How to store and show information

Today, weâ€™ll learn:

- What **operators** are
- How to use **comparison operators** (like `>`, `<`, `==`)
- How to use **if, else if, else** to make decisions
- Fun activities and challenges with conditions!

## ðŸ§  What Are Operators?

Operators are **symbols** we use to perform actions in code, like math or comparisons.

### âž• Math Operators (Arithmetic)

| Symbol | Meaning        | Example                  |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `+`    | Addition       | `5 + 3 = 8`              |
| `-`    | Subtraction    | `10 - 4 = 6`             |
| `*`    | Multiplication | `4 * 2 = 8`              |
| `/`    | Division       | `20 / 5 = 4`             |
| `%`    | Modulo         | `10 % 3 = 1` (Remainder) |

```js
console.log(4 + 3); // 7
console.log(10 % 4); // 2
```
