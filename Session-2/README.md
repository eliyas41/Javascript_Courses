# 🧒 JavaScript for Kids - Session 2: Variables and Data Types

Welcome to **Session 2**! 🎉  
In the last session, we learned how to:

- Print messages to the console
- Do simple math
- Run code using VS Code and the browser

Today, we’re going to learn:

- What variables are (and why we need them)
- Different **data types** in JavaScript
- How to use variables to store and show information

Let’s go! 🧠💡

## 🧠 What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a **box** where we store information so we can use it later.

🔍 Think of it like this:

- Imagine a labeled jar
- Inside the jar, you can put anything: your name, your age, a number, etc.
- You can open the jar any time and use what’s inside

In code, we create a variable like this:

```js
let name = "Amina";
let age = 12;
```
